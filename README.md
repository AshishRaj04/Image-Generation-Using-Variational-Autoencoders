# Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
 A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that learns to map input data to a latent space and generate new data from this space. It consists of an encoder that compresses the input into latent variables, and a decoder that reconstructs the data from these variables. VAEs introduce a probabilistic element by using the mean and variance of the latent space, allowing for smooth data generation. The model is trained using two losses: reconstruction loss (to measure data accuracy) and KL divergence (to regularize the latent space).
